                    <p>In addition, there are other automatic data collection technologies, such as Internet tags, web beacons (clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs), and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, etc.), HTML Local Storage, Social Widgets, or UTM Codes that can be used to collect data as users navigate through and interact with a website or emails.  These similar technologies can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which may include personal data.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Web Beacons. Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, are small strings of code that are embedded into web pages and your device that allow a website or application to count users and determine how long users visit web pages or applications.  We use web beacons for website traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, auditing and reporting, personalization, and other functions.</li>
                    
                        <li>Tracking Pixels.  A tracking pixel is a small piece of code we may use to collect and share information on your usage of our website, such as the pages that you have visited, or the way you have interacted with them. Through the tracking pixels, your browser automatically establishes a connection with the server of an online advertiser. In this way, the online advertiser receives information that you access our website. This can allow us to ensure that we are serving ads that match your interests, when you are visiting any of the websites of the online advertiser, or a website that includes ads served by the online advertiser. If you are authenticated to an online advertiser using tracking pixels, e.g. by being registered and logged in to a social network, the online advertiser can assign the visit to our website to your account. The data we may collect through tracking pixels is anonymous and does not include any personal data of individual users.  We have no influence on the extent to which the data collected through the tracking pixels is used by the online advertisers and therefore direct you to their privacy notices.</li>
