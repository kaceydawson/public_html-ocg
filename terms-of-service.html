                <h2 class="text-black">2. Account Registration and Security</h2>
                <p>In order to access the Services, you may be required to register and create an account or provide certain details or other information such as your full name, email address, professional information.  We may also need to verify your identity, and you authorize us to collect information from you and make any inquiries we consider necessary to do so (collectively referred to with all information requested to enable your account as <b>“Registration Information”</b>).  You represent and warrant that all of the Registration Information you provide in creating an account or in order to access some of the resources offered by the Services are true and complete and you agree to update your account upon any changes to such information.  The failure to do so may further limit your ability to use the Services and affect the accuracy and effectiveness of the same.</p>
                <p>You also agree that you are responsible for securely managing your Registration Information including, without limitation, the confidentiality of any usernames, passwords, personal identification numbers, and any other codes that you use to access our Services.  You may not provide your Registration Information to anyone else to access the Services.  You must keep your password strictly confidential.  You will notify us immediately if you believe that your Registration Information or device you use to access the Services has been lost or stolen or that someone is using your account without your permission.  You should regularly log into the Services to ensure that no unauthorized activity has occurred.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the website and any service, product, solution, or material we provide as part of our Services.  We will not be liable if for any reason all or part of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period.  From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Services to you.</p>
                <p>You agree not to attempt to log on to the Services from any country under sanctions by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Information regarding which countries are under sanctions may be obtained on the U.S. Department of the Treasury website. Any attempt to log on to the Services from one of these countries may result in your access being restricted and/or terminated.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-black">3. We Are Not a Lender or Creditor.</h2>
                <p>Our Services are designed for business or commercial uses and are not intended for individuals’ personal, family or household use.  We do not: (i) take credit applications; (ii) originate, service, or make loans or credit decisions; or (iii) issue commitments or lock-in agreements.</p>
                <p>As part of our Services, you may submit a Client Interest Form (a <b>“Client Interest Form”</b>) which is a request to be matched with third-party lenders (collectively <b>“Third-Party Lenders”</b>) of one or more financial products and services. When you submit a Client Interest Form, we will attempt to match you with Third-Party Lenders offering products or services for which you may qualify or that may be of interest to you.  You also agree that we may try to identify matches for similar or alternative products or services based on your requests and information provided in our Client Interest Form and that we may share your information with Third-Party Lenders of such similar or alternative products or services.</p>
                <p>Any Client Interest Form you submit is not an application for credit.  Rather, it is an inquiry or request to be matched with our Third-Party Lenders that may be able to present conditional loan offers to you, which offers are subject to change at any time, including at the point of application with the Third-Party Lender, after verification of information you provided, as well as other conditions as solely determined by any Third-Party Lender with whom you choose to proceed.  You are under no obligation to proceed with any Third-Party Lender or conditional offer.</p>
                <p>The submission of a Client Interest Form does not guarantee that you will receive any conditional loan offers or approvals.  Any conditional offer is based on information you provide when completing a Client Interest Form. <b>By submitting a Client Interest Form, you are providing express written consent for The Practice Consultant and Third-Party Lenders to obtain a limited credit report (“soft credit inquiry”) that will not affect your credit score and regardless of whether you provide your Social Security number.  It is possible that a Third-Party Lender may perform a soft credit inquiry on your credit at the same time for the same or similar purposes.  The Practice Consultant does not perform hard credit inquiries.</b></p>
                <p>Third-Party Lenders, and not The Practice Consultant, establish and maintain approval standards and determine the criteria necessary to receive both conditional offers and credit approvals.  You should review each Third-Party Lender’s terms and conditions to determine which offer works for you and your organization’s financial situation.  <b>We do not guarantee acceptance into any specific terms or conditions with any Third-Party Lender.  We do not guarantee that you will be approved for credit or that upon approval you will qualify for advertised rates, fees, or other terms.  We do not guarantee that rates or terms advertised or offered by Third-Party Lenders include the lowest or most favorable rates or terms available in the market.  All rates, fees, and other terms are presented without guarantee and are subject to change at any time based on each Third-Party Lender’s discretion.</b></p>
                <p>You may have to complete an application with a Third-Party Lender before the Third-Party Lender will extend an offer to you.  A Third-Party Lender you select may require you to pay an application or other fee to cover the costs associated with your application and you may be responsible for paying any and all closing costs associated with a loan (such as settlement services, loan processing, underwriting, or funding fees) as solely determined by the Third-Party Lender and not The Practice Consultant.</p>
                <p>Services offered by a Third-Party Lender may only be made to residents of states where a Third-Party Lender is authorized to conduct business.  A Third-Party Lender’s participation in and offering of its products and services through our Services does not necessarily constitute an offer by a Third-Party Lender or The Practice Consultant to provide services outside of their respective authorized jurisdictions.</p>
                <p>You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms, and Third-Party Lender best suits you and your organization’s financial situation.  The Third-Party Lender is solely responsible for its services to you, and you agree that The Practice Consultant shall not be liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of, or in any way connected with, your use of such services.  You understand that Third-Party Lenders may retain your loan request information, including information submitted through your Client Interest Form, and any other information provided by us or received by them in the processing of your loan inquiry or request, whether or not you are qualified to close a loan with them.  In addition, we may receive information, including personal data, regarding the disposition of your application, loan, or account from the Third-Party Lender in order to fulfill our regulatory requirements as well as for internal business purposes.</p>
